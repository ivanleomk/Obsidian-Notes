Hey there! My name is Ivan and I'm currently a software engineer who's trying to teach myself machine learning on the side. Here's a growing list of the notes which I've taken on the topic - I've also added in some simple system design notes and software stuff since they all sort of come together.

**Courses I am doing**

- [[Byte Byte Go Course]]
- [[The Definitive Guide to Celery and FastAPI]]

**Finished Courses**

- [[Zero To Hero]] by Andrej Karpathy
- [[Grokking Algorithms]] by Aditya Y. Bhargava

**Potentially In The Future**

Here are some resource which I find interesting but haven't gotten around to working on yet

- [[Guarev Sen]]
- [[System Design Fight Club]]
- [[Lewis Lin System Design]]
- [[Stanley Chiang System Design]]

I need to work a bit more on Machine learning
