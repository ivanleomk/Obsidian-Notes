# Machine Learning

In Machine Learning, we aim to get machines to learn to perform tasks they weren't programmed to do. We have

- **Supervised Learning** : Imitate a pattern given some dataset and labels
- **Unsupervised learning** : Learn how to cluster specific forms of data and generate insight

When we consider deep learning, we are using deep neural networks to get the results that we want. At the end of the day, a neural network is simply a collection of weights that you multiply your input data by to make a prediction.

**It accepts an input variable as information and a weight variable as knowledge and outputs a prediction**. 

Deep learning is an extension of machine learning where we aim to get machines to learn to perform tasks they weren't programmed to do using neural networks. 


# Neural Networks

## Basic Lin Alg

Vectors are simply a collection of numbers that can be $n$ dimensional in nature. The following are all vectors

```
[1,2,3] # (,3)

[[1,2],[2,3]] # (2,3)
```

and each vector has a shape which describes how information is organised within. We commonly use a library called [[Numpy]] to perform vector operations. ![[CleanShot 2023-09-11 at 21.37.37.png]]

## Forward Propagation

Neural networks are simply a collection of weights that we can multiply our inputs by. When we do so, we are performing what's known as forward propagation. This is because the neural networks are propagating the activations forward through the networks.
